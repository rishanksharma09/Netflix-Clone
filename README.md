# Netflix Clone 🎬

This is a **Netflix landing page clone** built using only **HTML and CSS**.  
It's a static, responsive replica of the Netflix India homepage — my **very first web development project**!

## 📌 What I Built

- A front-end clone of the Netflix homepage
- Built entirely with **HTML5** and **CSS3**
- Focused on layout, responsiveness, and basic styling
- No JavaScript used yet — keeping it simple as I'm just starting

## 👨‍💻 Why I Built This

I'm just beginning my web development journey, and this was my first hands-on project to apply what I've been learning.

Through this project, I learned:
- How to structure a web page with semantic HTML
- How to use CSS for layout, spacing, and responsive design
- The importance of attention to detail when cloning real websites
